# This Project is using the Unity ML Agent Toolkit

**The Unity Machine Learning Agents Toolkit** (ML-Agents) is an open-source
project that enables games and simulations to serve as environments for
training intelligent agents. We provide implementations (based on PyTorch)
of state-of-the-art algorithms to enable game developers and hobbyists to easily
train intelligent agents for 2D, 3D and VR/AR games. Researchers can also use the
provided simple-to-use Python API to train Agents using reinforcement learning,
imitation learning, neuroevolution, or any other methods. These trained agents can be
used for multiple purposes, including controlling NPC behavior (in a variety of
settings such as multi-agent and adversarial), automated testing of game builds
and evaluating different game design decisions pre-release. The ML-Agents
Toolkit is mutually beneficial for both game developers and AI researchers as it
provides a central platform where advances in AI can be evaluated on Unityâ€™s
rich environments and then made accessible to the wider research and game
developer communities.
